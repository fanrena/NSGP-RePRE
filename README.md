# Demystifying Catastrophic Forgetting in Two-Stage Incremental Object Detector

This is a Pytorch implementation of paper titled "Demystifying Catastrophic Forgetting in Two-Stage Incremental Object Detector", which has been accepted by ICML 2025.

**TL;DR:** We identify the RoI head classifier as the main source of forgetting in two-stage detectors and propose NSGP-RePRE, which uses Regional Prototype Replay and Null Space Gradient Projection to address it.
